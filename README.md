## singleLinkedList

1. the operatin of  insertion and deletion don't mean to insert at specify index, not including the search operation, so the bigO is 1;


## doubleLinkedList


## LRU cahe

1. hashmap: record the key,value

2. doubleLinkedList: put the rencently reading or writing data in front of the list(first delete,then insert at the top);

   > doubleLinkedList can easily delete and insert; 





## binary search

time complexiy analyze:

1. we need to divide by 2 until with have only one element-
𝑛/(2𝑘)=1

2. we can rewrite it as -

2𝑘=𝑛

by taking log both side, we get

𝑘=log2𝑛
